# YourCarbonFootprint

In a single .java file, please write a specialized calculator program that gets input from the user using a Scanner, and calculates a useful output.

Project Requirements
Though this project allows you to be creative, it must meet the following requirements to receive full credit:

It must use Scanner to interact with the user.
It must have at least three static methods (not including the main method), all of which are used in the program.
It must be at least 100 lines of code in length
It must have user input validation and recovery from bad input
It must validate user input with both while loops and try-catch blocks
Think of all possible ways your user could break your program: with non-numbers, negative numbers, non-sensensically large numbers, hitting enter many times... We will try to be extremely "non-ideal users," and will deduct points if we succeed at breaking your program.
It must allow the user to quit at any time that user input is requested.
It must contain no unused variables
It must give clear instructions to the user for getting inputs
It must give clear explanation of the calculated outputs
It must accurately use non-trivial mathematical formulas, and cite the sources of those formulas in a comment at the top of your file (these comments do not count towards the 100 line minimum)
All floating point outputs must be formatted to 2 places after the decimal point.
